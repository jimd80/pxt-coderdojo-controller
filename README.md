This is a DIY Game Controller for Micro:bit that costs under 4â‚¬ / 5$ if parts are ordered in volume. The USB cable can be stored at the back of the controller together with 2 AAA batteries.

## Building and sourcing parts

The (empty) PCB can be easily manufactured by any PCB company, for example JLCPCB which is known as the cheapest. The cable holder at the back can be 3D printed with any 3D printer, for example the affordable Creality Ender V2 or V3. It is recommended to print in (black) PETG as it is stronger and more fire resistant than PLA.

Other parts can be ordered at various electronics suppliers such as LCSC, Aliexpress, Digikey, Farnell, ... The most difficult part to source will be the Micro:bit EDGE Connector. This needs to be the horizontal SMD type. Start finding this connector first before deciding to build this project.

Soldering can be done with (Lead free) soldering paste and a reflow oven, or if you are a bit handy it can also be done with a classical soldering iron, lead-free soldering wire and some flux. In that case it will be handy to have something to keep the parts in place while soldering, such as a screwdriver.
